# Transfer Task: Learn Stage - Improve the Test Automation Strategy

## 1. Description

Reflect on the findings, risks, defects, observations, and insights
from the previously executed tasks and use them to improve the Test
Automation Strategy.

Participants should learn how continuous learning and feedback from
testing activities influence automation decisions and quality
engineering approaches.

---

## 2. Background

During the previous stages of the Holistic Testing Model, multiple
activities were executed, including:
- Exploratory testing
- Risk analysis
- T1&T5 test design
- Acceptance and regression testing
- Testing in production
- Log analysis
- Production validation

The collected findings now serve as input for the final Learn stage.

## Task Description

### Part 1 - (Title)

Review the outcomes from the previous stages and identify:
- Critical defects
- High-risk workflows
- Frequently failing functionality
- Production risks
- Regression-prone areas
- Stable vs unstable features
- Most business-critical user journeys

Identify:
- What worked well
- What created risks
- Which areas require stronger automation support
- Which tests would provide the highest value when automated

---

### Part 2 - (Title))

Create a prioritized list of the 10 most important T1&T5 tests that
should be automated.

For each test explain shortly:
- Why it should be automated
- Which risk it mitigates
- Which business value it protects

Focus on:
- High business impact
- High regression risk
- Frequently executed workflows
- Production stability
- Security-critical functionality

---

### Part 3 - (Title)

Adjust the existing Test Automation Strategy based on the findings.

Consider:
- Automation priorities
- Regression risks
- Production incidents
- Business-critical workflows
- Stability and maintainability
- Monitoring and feedback loops
- Consider the next goal for sprint 7 & 8 (go with the toolshop to new markets: United States & China, Customer Growth)

Define:
- Which areas should be automated first
- Which tests should remain manual or exploratory
- Which risks should be continuously monitored

## Outcome
- Create a table with following columns: 
- Name of use case/feature that should be covered with an automated test
- T1T5 test title 
- Implementation order (1-10)
- Reason
