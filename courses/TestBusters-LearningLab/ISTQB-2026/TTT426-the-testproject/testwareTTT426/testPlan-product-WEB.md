## 2. Test Objectives

The main objectives of this test plan are:

- Validation of the functional requirements of the web application  
- Ensuring a stable and error-free user experience  
- Early detection of critical defects  
- Reduction of risks in key business processes (e.g. registration and checkout)  



## 3. Test Scope

### 3.1 In Scope

The test scope is derived from the defined use cases and focuses on business-critical (**MUST**) and supporting (**SHOULD**) functionalities.

The following use cases are covered by this test plan:

### MUST  
*(business-critical core functionalities required for the main e-commerce workflow)*

- Authentication
- Checkout Flow
- Customer Account
- Product Category
- Product Detail
- Product Overview
- API Functionality (REST API, GraphQL API)  

These use cases are considered business-critical as they are essential for completing a purchase.



### SHOULD  
*(supporting and non-critical functionalities)*

- Contact Form
- Rentals  



The classification of business-critical (**MUST**) and supporting (**SHOULD**) use cases is based on the project requirements and scope definition.

A detailed mapping of all relevant features is provided in the **Feature Classification Table** below.

| T1 | Happy Path (standard case) | MUST and SHOULD |
| T2 | Alternative Scenarios | When alternative flows exist |
| T3 | Exception Cases | MUST |
| T4 | Negative Testing | MUST |
| T5 | Misuse Scenarios | When robustness or misuse risks exist |



### 5.5 Test Design Techniques

The following test design techniques are applied:

- Equivalence Partitioning  
- Boundary Value Analysis  
- Decision Table Testing  
- State Transition Testing  
- Scenario-based testing  
- Exploratory testing  
- Use-Case based (T1T5)



### 5.6 Traceability

Test cases are linked to corresponding user stories and acceptance criteria to ensure traceability.



### 5.7 Test Reporting and Defect Management

Test progress and results are continuously monitored and tracked using appropriate tools (e.g. GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and Trello).

Defects are systematically documented, tracked, and prioritized based on their severity and business impact.

This ensures transparency of the test process and supports effective decision-making throughout the testing lifecycle.

Defects include:

- Clear description  
- Steps to reproduce  
- Expected results  
- Actual results  
- Severity level  



## 6. Test Environment

Tests are performed in the following environment:

- Application: Practice Software Testing (Web)  
- Browser: Modern web browsers (e.g. Firefox)  
- Operating System: Windows-based systems  
- Internet connection required  

**URL:** https://practicesoftwaretesting.com  



## 7. Test Data

Typical test data is used to cover different application scenarios:

- User data (valid and invalid)  
- Password combinations with varying complexity  
- Product-related data  
- Shopping cart and checkout data  

Test data should be designed in a way that tests remain repeatable despite periodic database resets.



## 8 Test Automation

Detailed test automation activities are described in the separate Test Automation Strategy document.

REST API, REST API Documentation (Swagger), GraphQL API and GraphQL Playground (GraphiQL) are part of the product scope. Detailed API testing is covered separately in the Test Automation Strategy.
