# 1. Introduction

This Product Test Plan describes the test strategy, test scope, and planned test activities for the ToolShop WEB product.

The test plan is derived from the overarching Test Policy and defines how testing activities are implemented at the product level.

The objective of this test plan is to ensure that the application is tested in a systematic, structured, and traceable manner.

This version of the Product Test Plan has been updated for Release 6.0. The project timeline has been revised to reflect the updated milestone schedule, including the postponement of Milestone M3 and the shortened Phase 2. The existing product features remain within the test scope, while Release 6.0 extends the scope with the AI Assistant (F2.1) and additional Czech Market features. Test activities continue to be based on the project's Test Policy and the risk-based testing approach.

- Mobile applications (focus is on the web application only)
- Infrastructure and backend components outside the user interface (UI)
- Third-party integrations (where applicable)

---

# 5. Test Strategy

## 5.1 Test Levels

| Level | Description | Comment |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Component Testing | Verification of individual software components in isolation. | Performed by developers |
| System Testing | Validation of the complete integrated system against specified requirements. | Performed by testers |
| System Integration Testing | Validation of interactions between integrated system components through end-to-end user scenarios. | Performed by Test Engineer |
| User Acceptance Testing (UAT) | Validation of predefined acceptance criteria for the Czech Market features and the AI Assistant from a user perspective. | Performed by Test Engineer |

## 5.2 Quality Criteria Coverage (ISO 9126)

The following quality characteristics are considered within the testing activities for ToolShop WEB.

| Attribute | Sub-Attribute | Explanation | Validation Needed | Comment |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| Functionality | Suitability | Can software perform the tasks required? | MUST | |
| | Accuracy | Is the result of the calculations correct? | MUST | |
| | Interoperability | Can the system interact with another system? | MUST | |
| | Compliance | Does the system comply with applicable standards, regulations and business rules? | MUST | PCI-DSS, GDPR |
| Security | | Does the system prevent unauthorized access? | MUST | PCI-DSS |
| Usability | Understandability | Can users understand how the system works? | SHOULD | |
| | Learnability | Can users learn how to use the system efficiently? | SHOULD | |
| | Operability | Can users perform their tasks effectively? | MUST | |
| Reliability | Maturity | Does the system operate consistently without failures? | SHOULD | |
| | Fault Tolerance | Can the system continue to operate when faults occur? | SHOULD | |
| | Recoverability | Can the system recover after a failure? | SHOULD | |

The selected quality characteristics are aligned with ISO 9126 and support the evaluation of the overall product quality.

## 5.3 Test Approach

| Test Approach | Description | Comment |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| Risk-based testing | Testing activities are prioritized based on identified business and technical risks. | Focus on business-critical functionality |
| Requirements-based testing | Tests are derived from requirements, user stories and acceptance criteria. | Ensures traceability between requirements and tests |
| Use case-based testing | The focus is on validating user interactions and business-critical end-to-end processes of the web application. | Focus on end-to-end business workflows |
| User Acceptance Testing (UAT) | Validation of predefined acceptance criteria for the Czech Market features and the AI Assistant from a user perspective. | Executed by Test Engineer |
| Exploratory Testing | Testing is performed without predefined test cases while simultaneously learning and exploring the application. | Useful for discovering unexpected defects and usability issues |
| Regression Testing | Regression testing is performed after changes or bug fixes to ensure that existing functionality remains stable while introducing the Release 6.0 features. | Executed after bug fixes and releases |

## 5.4 Test Design Techniques

The following test design techniques are applied:

| Test Design Technique | Description | Minimum Coverage |
|------------------------|-------------|------------------|
| Equivalence Partitioning | Input data is divided into valid and invalid equivalence classes to reduce the number of test cases. | All input fields |
| Boundary Value Analysis | Tests values at the boundaries of valid and invalid input ranges. | Numeric and range-based input fields |
| Decision Table Testing | Tests combinations of conditions and business rules. | Business rules with multiple conditions |
| State Transition Testing | Verifies valid and invalid transitions between system states. | Features with defined state changes |
| Scenario-based Testing | Validates complete end-to-end user scenarios. | Business-critical workflows |
| Exploratory Testing | Simultaneous learning, test design and execution to discover unexpected defects. | Complex or high-risk areas |
| Use Case-based Testing (T1–T5) | Test scenarios are derived from user interactions using the T1–T5 model. | Focus on end-to-end business workflows |

The T1–T5 model is used to classify test scenarios for use case-based testing.

| Category | Description | Minimum Coverage |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| T1 | Happy Path (standard case) | All MUST features |
| T2 | Alternative Scenarios | Where alternative flows exist |
| T3 | Exception Cases | Critical exception scenarios |
| T4 | Negative Testing | Invalid and error scenarios |
| T5 | Misuse Scenarios | Where robustness or misuse risks exist |

## 5.5 Traceability

Test cases are linked to corresponding user stories and acceptance criteria to ensure complete traceability.

## 5.6 Test Reporting and Defect Management

Test progress and results are continuously monitored and tracked using appropriate tools (e.g. GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and Trello).

Defects are systematically documented, tracked, and prioritized based on their severity and business impact.

This ensures transparency throughout the test process and supports effective decision-making during the testing lifecycle.

Each defect report includes:

- Clear description
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected result
- Actual result
- Severity level

---

# 6. Test Environment

Tests are performed in the following environment:

- **Application:** Practice Software Testing (Web)
- **Browser:** Modern web browsers (e.g. Firefox)
- **Operating System:** Windows-based systems
- **Internet connection:** Required

**URL:** https://holtesting.practicesoftwaretesting.com

# 7. Test Data

Typical test data is used to cover different application scenarios:

- User data (valid and invalid)
- Password combinations with varying complexity
- Product-related data
- Shopping cart and checkout data
- AI Assistant input data (e.g. project descriptions, skill levels and budget information)

Test data should be designed to ensure repeatable test execution despite periodic database resets.

---

# 8. Test Automation

Detailed test automation activities are described in the separate **Test Automation Strategy** document.
