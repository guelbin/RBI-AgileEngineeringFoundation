1.1 Success Factors of a Test Automation Project
1.1.1 Define Goals & Objectives for a Test Automation Strategy
When defining the strategy of a test automation project, the following need to be addressed:
     ●      Defining the intended purpose
     ●      Identifying risks
     ●      Defining the scope
     ●      Identifying the stakeholders involved
     ●      Selecting the tools for automation
     ●      Designing the test automation architecture (TAA)
     ●      Identifying environments

Objectives of test automation may include:
     ●      Improved test efficiency
     ●      Broader and deeper coverage provided
     ●      Improved overall quality of the SUT
     ●      Reduced total cost and time to market
     ●      Performed tests that manual testers cannot do
     ●      Reduced test execution time
     ●      Increased test frequency
Since Agile software development provides faster deployment cycles, and cloud applications are more
widespread, development requires earlier and quicker feedback about the quality of the SUT. As a result
of this shift, test automation has more focus and relevance in modern projects, given its nature and test
objectives.

1.1.2 Identify Technical Success Factors of a Test Automation Project
The following success factors apply to test automation projects that focus on factors that impact the long-
term success of a project. The use of a pilot project helps determine the tools and viability of selected
technologies.
Success factors for test automation include the following:
     ●      SUT testability
                ○ Enables test automation to access SUT interfaces
     ●      Defined test automation strategy
                ○ The strategy needs to be applicable and customizable; its goals need to be achievable
                    within time and cost constraints, and it needs to be kept up-to-date
     ●      TAA
                ○ Clarity of what and how to implement
                ○ For additional information, see the CTAL-TAE Syllabus, section 3.1.1

 Certified Tester Test Automation Strategy Specialist (CT-TAS)

     ●      Test automation framework (TAF)
               ○ TAF that is easy to use, well documented and maintainable, supports a consistent
                    approach to automating tests. For additional information, see the CTAL-TAE Syllabus,
                    section 3.1.3.
               ○ Defined and implemented test reporting
               ○ Easy troubleshooting
               ○ Appropriate test environment
               ○ Documented automated test cases
               ○ Traceable automated tests to test case definitions and requirements
               ○ Easy maintenance
               ○ Up-to-date automated tests
               ○ A clear deployment plan
               ○ A clear test execution plan
               ○ Tests retired as needed
               ○ Effective exception handling
Before starting the test automation project, it is important to analyze the chance of success for the project
by considering the factors in place and the factors missing, keeping risks of the chosen test approach in
mind as well as the project context. Not all factors are required, and in practice, rarely are all factors met.

1.1.3 Summarize Appropriate Investment Criteria in Selecting Candidate Projects for
      Test Automation
Setting up test automation on a project means investment and, in most cases, significant cost. This should
be taken into consideration, together with the nature of the project, and whether test automation should be
used on the project.
Consider the following investment criteria before introducing test automation:
     ●      Cost of introduction: Besides the work needed to set up test automation, additional costs will be
            required for the project as there may be a need to hire new test automation engineers (TAEs), buy
            new hardware, or set up training
     ●      Current phase in the project’s software development lifecycle (SDLC): It is better to start as early
            as possible so that test automation can bring more value sooner
     ●      Expected/planned duration of the project/software development: For a shorter project, there may
            not be enough resources to start, or time left for test automation to bring value
     ●      Maintenance cost: In the case of starting from scratch, setting up a test automation solution (TAS)
            will take time along with the need to be maintained
If the investment of introducing test automation on a project is acceptable, preparation for test automation
can begin. This includes selecting the right test approach and test automation tools. The primary
responsibility for this process is a strategic role of a test architect or test manager, who has the necessary
test automation knowledge to make relevant decisions.

 Certified Tester Test Automation Strategy Specialist (CT-TAS)

2.1 Costs and Risks of Implementing a Test Automation Solution
2.1.1 Compare Alternative Technical Solutions with Regard to Cost of Ownership
In terms of ownership, a common approach is a customized in-house solution based on open-source or
commercial tools. Other alternative approaches include non-customizable commercial solutions or signing
a contract with an outsource company to get the work done by the TAE.
Creating all the TAS in-house ensures that all costs, resources, risks, and governance are within the
organization (e.g., team members/developers, and hardware and software resources that are necessary
for the actual solution). A key factor is that, by following this approach and allocating time to this activity,
the TAS can be developed without a need for a contract with a vendor or outsource company, as every
required TAE and their knowledge is available within the organization. However, to carry it out successfully,
the organization needs to have the right TAEs, hired or trained, who can drive the development of the TAS.
Working with a vendor-based solution, ownership will be shared between the client and the vendor
depending on the details of their contract. If there is already a test tool in the organization that has already
been piloted and meets all the requirements, and there is no need for additional features in the test tool,
this approach will be easier to adopt. The testers within the organization will be able to work productively
once receiving the necessary training from the vendor, and usually there will be subject matter experts
(SMEs) assigned as product owners inside the organization. The risk with this approach is that if any
additional work needs to be done (e.g., fix tool defects, and additional feature requests) to the test tool, it
will take time and require negotiations with the vendor to get it done on time and done in the right way,
which can affect the work of the testers who are working with this test tool.
If the organization does not want to have the ownership of setting up a team, outsourcing is a recommended
solution. In the case of working with outsource companies, the client does not have to hire or buy any actual
hardware, software, or recruit employees with the required skill set. All the work and additional costs will be
with the outsource company along with the ownership of the tools as well. Measurable expectations and
metrics must be defined in the contract to make the progress transparent and visible. This approach is
suggested in case the organization does not plan to invest efforts into hiring TAEs due to short project
timelines, costs, or other considerations.

2.1.2 Explain Licensing Model Considerations for Test Automation Tools
Licensing is an important aspect to consider when test automation is established. Each licensing model
mentioned below has a different impact on usability and cost factors e.g., costs of test execution, and
difficulty to set up the development environment.
Licensing models include:
     ●      Open-source: In many cases, organizations are using open-source tools to achieve their test
            objectives in test automation. The main reason for this is that there are no license costs or any
            maintenance fees for the use of the test tools. Many users and organizations contribute towards
            the development of open-source tools which makes information gathering and receiving support
            easier. Most open-source licenses also allow people to modify the tools if necessary or even
            republish them without significant restrictions.

 Certified Tester Test Automation Strategy Specialist (CT-TAS)

     ●      License per user/machine: Commercial tools often have licensing per user(s) or machine(s). In
            terms of costs, tools can be used efficiently when the organization knows the number of TAEs
            who will work on a given project for the long term. Often, the more licenses an organization
            orders, the better the pricing they receive.
     ●      Floating license: This is a license that can be shared between multiple people in the
            organization to be used at different times. It can be very useful when there are many TAEs who
            work on different machines. The number of licenses is calculated based on concurrent use, not
            total number of TAEs or specific machines on which they run their tests.
     ●      Runtime license: Many commercial tools have runtime licenses for executing test automation.
            This type of license occurs with cloud vendors that host test automation tools, multiple operating
            systems (OSs), and browser versions as a service. There are also cloud vendors that provide
            access to device farms that have a variety of mobile devices, platforms, versions, and cellular
            networks. Those that utilize these services are only charged for the time they use to execute
            tests, and therefore are charged on a runtime license basis.

2.1.3 Provide Examples of Factors to be Considered When Defining a Test Automation
      Strategy
Many factors can influence decisions about test automation implementation and its strategy.
The most crucial factors are:
     ●      Time constraints
     ●      Needed level of expertise and number of TAEs to develop the TAS
     ●      Test hardware
     ●      Test tool licenses
     ●      Adaptability
     ●      Maintenance
     ●      Support for different platforms (e.g., Web, desktop and/or mobile)
     ●      Continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) support
     ●      Test management integration and test reporting
The first and most important cost factor is the timeline for the work that must be done and for the test
automation itself.
From a timing perspective, if the deadline is short, an approach often used is to hire only a few skilled TAEs
to create the TAS. In terms of a longer roadmap and schedule, the organization can decide on the number
of required TAEs with more context. When the SUT grows, improves, and becomes more complex, a
decision can be made to hire more TAEs to implement and maintain the TAS and the tests.
Other important cost factors are the tools and their licenses. The budget should contain the required test
tools, hardware, and additional training for the TAEs. These factors have a strong connection to the
integration to other tools and systems to do any additional non-testing functions like uploading test results
to the test management system or triggering a build to the configuration management system. For these
additional functions there are tools, either free or with fees, and libraries to use, but these must be
considered during the creation of the test automation strategy and should be included in the budget.

 Certified Tester Test Automation Strategy Specialist (CT-TAS)

It is always context dependent as to how many test environments and agents a development team has.
The larger and more complex the SUT and release schedule is, the more resources the organization will
require, which will increase the cost as well. A recent approach to limit resource costs use cloud providers
and pay for on demand test hardware resources and runtime licenses which must be used carefully as it
can backfire. Sometimes machines can be left running and become more expensive than on their own
hardware. This approach can reduce the high costs of maintenance and operation for the TAE team.

2.2 Roles and Responsibilities within Test Automation
2.2.1 Summarize the Roles and Skills Necessary for a Successful Test Automation
      Solution
For a successful TAS, organizations require skilled TAEs who should have strong programming and
technical architecture knowledge.
Depending on the size and maturity of the project, there should also be at least one strong SME (e.g., a
test lead, architect, and business analyst) who understands the actual business domain and the test
objectives. The role of this person is to help drive and create the concept, based on test objectives, and a
roadmap for the actual TAS. Team management and soft skills will be needed to train, motivate, and build
the team for the actual work. [CTEL-TM-MTT]

A TAE should have strong technical skills and knowledge about different SDLCs, and about the architecture
of the SUT and its development environment. Apart from the technical aspects, a TAE should have the
ability to cooperate with test analysts and other stakeholders about the objectives of test automation. Since
exhaustive testing is not achievable, the same applies for test automation: 100% test automation coverage
is not achievable. As time and effort are limited, the TAEs need to be able to prioritize the most impactful
test conditions to cover from a business and investment perspective by contributing to risk assessments.

 Certified Tester Test Automation Strategy Specialist (CT-TAS)

3.1 Integration Across Test Levels
3.1.1 Differentiate Between Test Automation Distributions
Mike Cohn devised the original concept of a test automation pyramid describing three levels: unit (the
ISTQB calls this component), service, and UI. Since then, many variations have appeared, and they all
share the same basic principles of describing the role of test levels and distribution of test cases across
those levels (see the ISTQB CTFL Syllabus, section 5.1.6 Test Pyramid).
The focus in Mike Cohn’s original test automation pyramid is on what test types are carried out by the
TAS. The service level can be broken down into three test types: component integration testing, contract
testing and API testing.
Unit testing, (the ISTQB calls this component testing) is for validating individual components, focusing on
the code quality. Component integration testing allows for validation of the user interface (UI) and API by
leveraging test doubles, such as mocks and stubs. Contract testing enables validation of the contracts
between services. API testing focuses on the functional validation of given services with real data through
real service connections. UI testing is end-to-end testing of a system, interacting with its GUI.
It is helpful to draw the current state of testing as a baseline and the target state. This provides a clear
understanding of what is missing or what is an acceptable level of testing. This will indicate the amount of
testing carried out on each test level and whether it is manual or automated testing. The target state also
depends on the timeline, and what is achievable within that time frame. If feasible to achieve, then the
pyramid shape should be the target shape.
Examples of test distributions:
     ●      Pyramid: This is a balanced distribution of testing with less testing carried out on the higher test
            levels and more on the lower test levels with stable and quicker tests. If the available resources
            and time frame allows it, then this is often the target state pyramid.
     ●      Ice cream cone: This is the inverted version of the pyramid. There is a balanced amount of
            service testing, but testing is heavily dependent on finding the majority of defects in the UI test
            level, which is typically more costly to automate due to its complexity. Due to the lack of
            component testing, defects are found later in the SDLC.
     ●      Hourglass: Testing is heavy on the highest and lowest test levels, and service level testing is
            mostly missing, resulting in integration defects. If the business logic is provided by APIs (i.e.,
            services), then many of the UI tests can easily be moved to lower test levels.
     ●      Umbrella: Testing is completely dependent on costly UI tests. This results in slow defect
            turnaround, costly maintenance of test cases and the TAS. If it is not technically possible to
            implement lower-level test cases, then moving away from the umbrella shape might not be
            achievable, and the focus should be on optimizing the UI test automation suite, reducing test
            execution time, and improving stability.

Figure 1: Examples of Test Distributions

3.1.2 Select a Test Automation Approach Based on the System Under Test
      Architecture
There are many ways one can define the test levels in a test strategy. Which one to choose is heavily
dependent on several factors such as the organization’s culture, overall maturity of software engineering,
the SDLC followed and whether the SUT has a mainframe or microservices architecture.
Although the pyramid shape is considered as the ideal test distribution, it is not always achievable, or
takes a longer time to transition to that final state. It is good practice to have a realistic shape as the
target state such as transforming from the umbrella shape to the hourglass one. Once that is achieved, a
new target state can be determined.
Choosing the appropriate test automation distribution for mainframe systems differs from modern
software development and again depends on many factors as some of the levels might not be possible to
automate at all. Access to mainframes is traditionally done through terminal emulation (i.e., green
screens). Validation of the batch processes is possible but limited. Component testing is more difficult to
carry out. As there are little to no microservices present, it is not always an option to validate data
communication between interfaces with API testing. Testing through batch jobs, databases and a GUI is
more prevalent.
Organizations that are modernizing their legacy solutions, slowly shifting towards a microservices
architecture can introduce API testing and contract testing to the modernized parts of the system.

3.1.3 Demonstrate Ways to Optimize Test Automation Distribution to Achieve Shift Left
       and Shift Right Approaches
Once the current state distribution is identified and the target state distribution is selected, then a
roadmap of improvements can be planned. This determines what to test with automation (i.e., the scope
of test automation) and how to test (i.e., the test automation strategy). A prioritized backlog of items to
implement and the entry criteria for test automation need to be determined.
In case of an unbalanced test automation distribution, it is recommended to go with a bottom-up
approach. If code coverage is low, then it is a sign of a lack of component test cases, and additional
component test cases need to be written. As a second step, the quality of the component tests needs to
be reviewed and, if necessary, improved. Suggesting best practices, following a test-driven development
technique, and holding test technique workshops can improve the quality of the test automation.

 Certified Tester Test Automation Strategy Specialist (CT-TAS)

Introducing component testing for UI and API tests, leveraging test doubles (e.g., mocks, stubs) helps
achieve a shift left from expensive, slow, and unreliable tests. Removing the reliance on real services and
data improves the consistency of test execution and provides early feedback that is easy to integrate into
CI/CD pipelines.
In recent years, contract testing has been increasingly prominent. By validating the contract between a
provider and a consumer, it is easier to find root causes of defects earlier. Teams will not be reliant on
API tests, nor UI tests to detect defects from underlying services, and instead can decrease the number
of such test cases. Building a call graph for APIs is a clever way to track which APIs are connected to
each other, and which ones are the consumers or the producers of a selected API. This allows better
identification of potential pain points of a system.
While shift left is an approach that involves moving tests earlier in the SDLC, shift right moves tests later,
when the SUT has been released, as a means to evaluate performance in a pre-production test
environment or in production. By applying shift right, testers can monitor application and API performance
while getting feedback from actual users. Although test automation is more prominent in a shift left
approach, if it is combined with observability, then test automation can help in making decisions quicker
on whether a full release can go ahead, or the release candidate needs to be rolled back.
Shift right testing aims to:
    ●       Understand user preferences
    ●       Support canary releases and dark launches to minimally disrupt user functionality
    ●       Identify defects in production early
    ●       Help expand the scope and use of test automation
    ●       Increase coverage

3.2 Strategic Considerations in Different Software Development Lifecycle
              Models
3.2.1 Explain How Test Automation Projects Conform with Legacy Software
      Development Lifecycle Models
In the waterfall model, the testing phase comes after the requirement analysis, system design and
implementation phases. Due to that strict order, test automation activities start later. Longer cycles
between testing means fewer opportunities to leverage test automation, and the feedback from test
automation usually comes too late, resulting in a lower return on investment (ROI).
In the V-model, all the test planning along with documentation preparation happens in early phases. As
an example, the architecture design phase produces the integration test design, which sets up testing
earlier than in the waterfall. Unfortunately, the actual implementation of a TAS still comes later in the
SDLC, and although the ROI of test automation is higher compared to the waterfall model, it still falls
behind modern Agile software development practices.

 Certified Tester Test Automation Strategy Specialist (CT-TAS)

3.2.2 Explain How Test Automation Projects Conform with Agile Software
      Development Best Practices that Support Test Automation
One of the ideals of following Agile software development is to achieve in-sprint test automation. This
means determining all the necessary test automation activities as part of the exit criteria for each of the
user stories. It includes the test case definitions, implementation of automated test cases, updates to the
TAF and in some cases integration to a CI/CD pipeline. Organizations that do not apply Agile practices
correctly do not include an estimate of test effort and either administer them in a separate ticket or do not
monitor them at all. By achieving in-sprint test automation, Agile teams ensure that they are ready to
deploy the agreed scope within or by the end of each sprint. If a team is not mature from an Agile
perspectives, then the first goal should be achieving in-sprint testing, while automation would lag behind
by a sprint. From that, a team can work their way into achieving in-sprint test automation.

3.2.3 Prepare for Test Automation Projects to Conform with DevOps Best Practices to
      Achieve Continuous Testing
Agile software development is focused on how work is organized, while DevOps is responsible for the
end-to-end delivery of software. This is achieved by automating build, integration, test, deployment, and
production activities. This facilitates continuous testing through feedback loops that ensure continuous
improvement.
Emphasis is more on implementing lower-level automated test cases including component, component
integration and contract tests. Reducing reliance on real data and services, the tests will be executed in a
shorter time. If feasible, test automation should be executed in the same pipeline where the SUT is built.
Different test suites are triggered after each development and build phase (e.g., local, pull request,
merge, and deploy).
If the testers have the capacity to build larger UI and API test suites, then those are executed separately
to provide additional value. Manual testing efforts are suggested to focus on exploratory testing and end-
user feedback, as a complementary activity to test automation.

3.3 Applicability and Viability of Test Automation
3.3.1 Explain Criteria for Determining the Suitability of Tests for Test Automation
Selecting test cases for test automation is usually done by a test analyst who either understands which
test cases can be automated, or by a TAE who has the necessary domain knowledge to make such
decisions.

 Certified Tester Test Automation Strategy Specialist (CT-TAS)

The following are considered when selecting and prioritizing test cases for test automation:
     ●      Is it technically possible to implement the test cases in an automated fashion?
     ●      Are there any technical challenges that impact the delivery of automated test cases? Is the team
            prepared and well trained to do the implementation work?
     ●      Does the coding effort provide an adequate ROI? (see section 5.1.1)
     ●      Is there value in running the test cases frequently?
     ●      Is it a functional or non-functional test? Is it part of the smoke test suite, regression test suite, or
            confirmation test suite?
     ●      Is the test case repeatable?
     ●      Is the test case easy to maintain when the SUT changes due to updates?
     ●      Does the test case cover frequently used business workflows?
     ●      Is there a functional overlap between tests that allow reusability of test steps and test data?

3.3.2 Identify Challenges that Only Test Automation Can Address
There are certain tests that can only be carried out with test automation. These include categories when:
     1      Manual test execution time takes longer than what is adequate
     2      Execution of test cases need to be synchronized
     3      Test results need to be available in a pipeline
     4      Large log files need to be parsed for defects
     5      Precision in timing in tests is required
     6      Test permutations are required across multiple OSs, browsers, devices, locations, or
            configurations
     7      A large volume of test executions and/or data input is required to maximize coverage
     8      Any non-functional testing that requires automated monitoring and analysis, or input from a huge
            amount of users such as stress testing or reliability testing

 Certified Tester Test Automation Strategy Specialist (CT-TAS)

3.3.3 Identify Test Conditions that are Difficult to Automate
There are certain test conditions that make automating test cases a difficult challenge or even an
impossible task. There are many real-life examples. Some of these are listed below:
     ●      Validation of design requirements including the consistency of the UI through different platforms.
            The overall look and feel of software are subjective and require a human’s review.
     ●      Any test case that involves too much human interaction. In the finance sector, a good example
            would be a loan application. In this process there can be cases of certain regulations or
            conditions (e.g., not enough income, and incorrect personal details). In such situations, agents
            need to double check the actual loan application and make manual decisions or contact the
            customer.
     ●      Technical difficulties blocking test automation activities, such as OS level restrictions. One
            example is native OS software which sends text messages to the users. Interactions or
            validations of those text messages are not possible with UI test automation tools, as the OS does
            not allow interactions outside of the target SUT.
     ●      Test conditions with a lengthy time dependency would make test automation inefficient and is
            often difficult to properly set up compared to manual test execution. As an example, the tester
            needs to login to the SUT, refresh the home page content and wait two hours for the SUT to
            automatically logout due to a session timeout. If the elapsed time cannot be altered in any manual
            way (e.g., mocks, server-side responses, and OS level time changes), then implementing such
            test cases in an automated fashion is not advised.

4.1 Test Automation Solution Planning
4.1.1 Identify ways how test automation supports shorter time to market
Test automation helps bring software to the market faster because it helps cut down on the test cycle
time. Testing prior to a software release requires a thorough amount of verification and validation. This
can be particularly significant during regression testing as this type of testing promotes reuse, driving
down cost, and providing consistency between test executions.
Test automation helps decrease the manual test effort and provides quick feedback to developers while
covering the same scope of testing. It also allows testing earlier in the software development lifecycle if
component tests and component integration tests are automated, which are typically not performed in a
manual fashion.
A quality gate is an enforced measure built into your process that the software needs to meet before it
can proceed to the next phase. Setting up quality gates based on test automation allows an accelerated
deployment process to a pre-production or to a production environment. By leveraging these quality
gates, defects can be found earlier, which results in the time to market being shorter. Test execution time
can be reduced by leveraging parallel test execution and following a shift left approach. A shift left
approach promotes a culture of quality consciousness and encourages testing earlier in the software
development lifecycle. This may include multiple independent test cases or cross-browser testing.
For additional information, see sections 3.1.3, 6.1.2, and 6.2.1.

4.1.2 Identify Ways in Which Test Automation Helps Verify Reported Defects
Confirmation testing performed following a code fix can address a reported defect. A tester typically follows
the test steps necessary to replicate the defect to verify that the defect no longer exists.
Defects have a way of reintroducing themselves into subsequent releases (e.g., this may indicate a
configuration management or code repository management problem) and therefore confirmation tests are
suitable candidates for test automation and can be added to the existing regression test suite.
An automated confirmation test typically has a narrow scope of functionality. Implementation can occur at
any point once a defect is reported and the test steps needed to replicate it are understood.
Tracking automated confirmation tests allows for reporting the time and the number of test cycles expended
in resolving defects.
By verifying fixes across multiple platforms, devices, browsers, and OS versions with test automation, the
amount of time spent on testing is greatly reduced.

4.1.3 Define Approaches that Allow for the Development of Operationally Relevant
       Scenarios for Test Automation
Operational acceptance testing assures software readiness for production systems and is typically
conducted right before a release. This effort is meant to do a final validation of the systems, components,
and other infrastructure of the SUT, and to test its readiness for production. This is necessary because
despite a TAE’s best efforts, there is no guarantee that the SUT will behave the same way outside of the
test environment and in production.
A good operational test plan will include testing for reliability, testing for fault tolerance, integrity, and
maintainability. Below are test automation approaches that can be used:
     ●      Static code analysis – Automated tools that analyze code for security and vulnerabilities. Test
            results are stored for trend analysis over time.
     ●      End-to-end testing – Automated test scripts that conduct end-to-end user scenarios and exercise
            all aspects of the test environment to uncover any defects.
     ●      Failover testing – Automated test scripts that specifically test what happens when an application’s
            hardware comes offline. Some examples include how does the application recover when physical
            servers, cloud servers, networks, computer disks and other hardware components malfunction.
            Test scripts are designed to measure success or failure of the SUT’s ability to automatically
            recover and this is particularly important for organizations implementing chaos engineering.
     ●      Backup and restore testing – Automated test scripts that test the success of making a backup of
            the current version and then rolling back to a previous point (i.e., an older version of the software)
     ●      Performance efficiency testing (e.g., load testing) – Automated test scripts that can be used to
            simulate many users exercising the SUT at once. Test results are stored for comparison and
            trended over time.
     ●      Operational documentation review – Automated test scripts can be used for this activity to
            compare versions of the SUT’s documentation and signal to development teams whether an
            update is needed based on new features being added to a particular release.
     ●      Security testing – Automated test scripts can be created in combination with industry standard
            security test tools to evaluate the SUT, in a static and dynamic manner. Test results are stored
            over time for comparison and trend analysis.
     ●      Monitoring based on an organization’s service level agreement – Automated test scripts used
            during the SDLC can be repurposed to monitor production operations and send alerts if an
            automated test fails. This is a proactive measure to catch production outages before real users
            experience them.
Test automation for operational software validation can provide immense benefits especially if the
automated tests can be executed repeatedly and in multiple environments. Dedicated automated test
suites can be created so that test results can be generated and compared with previous test executions.
This ensures consistency when new versions of the SUT are released. A reliable automated test suite of
operational specific test conditions can reduce costs over time.

4.2 Test Automation Deployment Strategies
4.2.1 Define a Test Automation Deployment Strategy
A good test automation deployment strategy will take into account, but not limited to, the overall test
environment, the test tools that are available, access to the SUT, test script storage and other
dependencies, and test data provisioning. With these high-level considerations in mind, a TAE can begin
thinking about a strategy for developing and deploying the TAS.
Test environment – The TAEs should consider how they are going to access the SUT in the different
test environments. When they start to develop their test automation testware, whether they are using a
keyword-driven approach or another solution, they must consider how this solution will run in multiple test
environments. For example, a test script should be developed in such a way that it can run in a test
environment and in a pre-production environment with minimal changes. Typically, it is a matter of
changing a uniform resource locator (URL) for a Web-based application and then the test script runs the
same way regardless of which test environment it is in.
Tools – TAEs will also need to consider what tools they are using to build the TAS. If it is a commercial
tool, chances are they will need to understand how it is licensed. The TAE may find that their test
environment needs to have access to the tool’s license server. This needs to be considered when the test
script is intended to be used in multiple test environments. Just because the licensing server is available
in the test environment does not necessarily mean it will be available in the pre-production environment.
Software access – Important considerations need to be understood on how to access the SUT. Test
scripts can be designed to accept parameters so that specific users or credentials with special access
can be quickly updated when the SUT end points change. This again becomes very important when
moving into different test environments and the URL needs to change. In addition, it may be necessary to
use different credentials (e.g., via user and test accounts, biometrics, and smart cards) depending on the
pre-production environment. A good, automated test script design will include enough flexibility so that
simple parameters can be set, and the test scripts executed as expected regardless of the test
environment.
Test script storage – The TAE will want to decide on a central location to store and manage automated
test scripts. A good strategy would incorporate a source code repository that utilizes configuration
management. In this way, the test scripts can be accessible from multiple test environments as long as
they have access to the source code repository and versions can be created for the specific version of the
SUT. All configurations and dependencies can be saved in the same repository as the test scripts and
provide optimal portability. In short, the TAS, TAF, and all test cases can be stored and managed within
repositories.

 Certified Tester Test Automation Strategy Specialist (CT-TAS)

Data provisioning – It will be important to understand if an automated test script is dependent on certain
test data already existing in the test environment where the SUT is being tested. Good test script design
will avoid static data (i.e., fixed data sets) as much as possible. However, there will be situations where it
is not feasible. In these cases, the TAE will need to determine a solution to have the test data preloaded
or use test automation to create setup test scripts that generate the necessary test data before the real
test scripts run and test the SUT. There are pros and cons to both approaches. On the one hand it is
convenient to have an administrator preload test data. However, the TAE then relies on another resource
to have the availability to support them. Being self-sufficient with a setup test script removes the need to
rely on another resource. However, it takes time to put these test scripts together and becomes another
part of the solution that needs to be maintained.
By accounting for all of the items mentioned above, the test automation strategy will be able to provide
proper planning and control of test automation activities.

4.2.2 Identify Test Automation Risks in Deployment
Technical issues can lead to product risks and project risks (for additional information, see the CTFL
Syllabus, section 5.2.2). Typical technical issues include:
     ●      Too many abstractions can lead to difficulty in understanding what the test automation code is
            really doing (e.g., with keywords in the keyword-driven approach)
     ●      Test data tables can become too large/complex/cumbersome to migrate to other test
            environments resulting in inconsistent status outcomes
     ●      Dependency on the TAS to use certain OS libraries or other components that may not be available
            in all the test environments of the SUT
Typical deployment project risks include:
     ●      Staffing issues: Getting the right people to maintain the test automation may be difficult
     ●      Unplanned TAS maintenance due to SUT updates that cause the TAS to operate incorrectly
     ●      Delays in introducing test automation
     ●      Delays in updating the TAS based on the changes done to the SUT
     ●      The TAS cannot capture nonstandard UI objects
     ●      Allowing outdated test cases to remain in test suites, wasting test execution time
Potential failure points of the TAS project include:
     ●      Migration to a different test environment
     ●      Deployment to a production environment
     ●      Forgetting that automation is software that should also be tested
It is important to realize that various technical issues, project risks, and potential failure points can
jeopardize the success of test automation projects. Common technical issues include complexities
arising from excessive abstractions, challenges with test data management, and dependencies on
specific components. Project risks also need to account for difficulties in staffing, maintenance issues due
to system updates, deployment delays, and the presence of outdated test cases. Additionally, potential
failure points such as migration to different environments and neglecting the need to test the automation
software itself, should be addressed with proper planning. Overall, monitoring and proactive measures
will ensure the success of test automation projects.

4.2.3 Define Approaches To Mitigate Deployment Risks
There are many risk mitigation strategies that can be employed to deal with these risk areas. Some of
these are discussed below.
The TAS has an SDLC of its own, whether it is in-house developed or an acquired solution. One thing to
remember is that the TAS, like any other software, needs to be under configuration management and its
features documented. Otherwise, it becomes exceedingly difficult to deploy different parts of it and make
them work together or work in certain test environments.
Also, there has to be a documented, clear, and easy to follow deployment procedure. This procedure is
version dependent; therefore, it has to be included under configuration management as well.
There are two distinct cases when deploying a TAS:
     1. First-time deployment
     2. Maintenance deployment – the TAS already exists, and an update needs to be deployed
The risks related to the first-time deployment include:
     ●      Total test execution time of the test suite may be longer than the planned test execution time for
            the test cycle. In this case it is important to make sure to plan enough time for the test suite to
            execute in its entirety before the next scheduled test cycle begins.
     ●      Installation and configuration issues with test environments exist (e.g., database setup and initial
            load, and services start/stop). The TAS needs a test fixture (i.e., a predefined dataset) to create
            the necessary preconditions for automated test cases to run within the test environment.
For maintenance deployments, there are additional considerations. The TAS in itself needs to evolve, and
the updates for it have to be deployed into production. Before deploying an updated version of the TAS
into production, it needs to be tested. It is therefore necessary to check the new functionality, to verify that
a test suite can be run on the updated TAS, that test reports can be sent, and that there are no performance
defects or other quality issues. In some cases, the entire test suite may need to be changed to fit the latest
version of the TAS.

4.3 Dependencies within the Test Environment
4.3.1 Define test automation components in the test environment
Test automation components typically consist of tools, virtual machines, automation test scripts,
containers, and configurations. The test environment also includes the SUT. The test automation
components in the test environment can be defined as follows:
SUT – This is an obvious part of the test environment. The SUT can be tested as a whole or divided into
subcomponents (e.g., API, Web-based interface, and database).
Platform – The platform describes where the test automation components are hosted. This includes the
cloud infrastructure, network, virtual machines, and containers that may be used to make test automation
efficient and portable.

 Certified Tester Test Automation Strategy Specialist (CT-TAS)

Test cases and test suites – This describes individual test cases that are made up of test steps that
direct both automated and manual actions. The test suites describe a logical grouping of test cases so
that they can be executed together efficiently.
Tools – Different test automation tools are used for several reasons. A collection of tools would include
those for UI test automation, testing API endpoints, data generation, monitoring, requirements
management, defect management, logging and reporting tools, and tools for generating trends based on
metrics.
TAF – This includes all the items that go into making up the TAF design. TAFs include driver scripts,
common libraries, templates for automated test cases, data loading/provisioning scripts, documentation
on how to use TAF components, and tutorials that help TAEs utilize the TAF. For additional information,
see the CTAL-TAE Syllabus, section 3.1.
Maintenance of the test components is a major consideration because overcomplicating the test
environment may result in hours of unwanted time fixing defects in the TAF instead of benefiting from the
solution. It is important to find the right blend of tools, configuration, and platform portability to make the
components as reusable as possible.

4.3.2 Identify Infrastructure Components and Dependencies of Test Automation
There are a number of infrastructure components and dependencies to be aware of when assembling test
automation. Collectively they cover all of the prerequisites necessary to run a TAS. The major
components and dependencies include:
Host machines – These can be virtual machines, physical servers, laptops, and devices (e.g., tablet, and
mobile). They have the test automation software installed on them and that is where test scripts are
created and executed.
Network – This is what gives the TAS access to the SUT. It can also include the networking together of
multiple host machines to provide parallel execution of automated tests. Typically, host machines are
required to be on the same network and configured properly to communicate with each other.
Platform – Test automation, like any other software, can run on cloud platforms or designed to run in
containers. As long as the platform provides permissions and access to the underlying OS, all necessary
tools and dependencies can be installed.
Software dependencies – To make the test automation tools perform correctly, it is necessary to
understand all other dependencies that the test automation has. For example, a particular test automation
tool may require the latest version of a programming language to be installed on the host machine first.
TAEs need to account for these dependencies before and after selecting a tool.
SUT – Once the components, dependencies, and overall infrastructure have been considered and
configured properly, the last step is to ensure access to the SUT. In addition to the network, it is also
necessary to consider how to interface with the SUT. For example, in a Web-based application, a browser
needs to be installed on the host machine. The type of browser and version needs to be considered.

 Certified Tester Test Automation Strategy Specialist (CT-TAS)

4.3.3 Define Test Automation Data and Interface Requirements
Two considerations TAEs need to think about before developing test automation scripts are how they
plan to interface with the SUT and what are the data dependencies of the test cases. The following are
examples:
API – If the SUT utilizes an API, this can be tested at the end point level instead of requiring a UI to
interface at the application level. This may require a deeper understanding of the end points and data
communications that are hidden by a UI. The TAE would have to understand in what order to call APIs to
create a business process and how to correlate the data to keep the test case intact. APIs that are
exposed to the Internet are also called web APIs or web services.
Database interface – Some test automation tools have the ability to interface directly with the SUT’s
underlying database. Test scripts can be written to verify data within columns and rows to ensure that
stored procedures and other database rules are configured properly. This may require specific data
values to already exist in the database for reliability testing.
Interface compatibility – Use of contract testing ensures that two separate systems (e.g., two
microservices) are compatible and are able to communicate with one another. Contracts testing can be
consumer-driven, producer-driven, and bidirectional. Additional details can be found in the CTAL-TAE
Syllabus, section 5.1.3.
Furthermore, TAEs must carefully consider how they will interface with the SUT and understand the data
dependencies within test cases. Whether testing through APIs, database interfaces, or ensuring interface
compatibility between systems, attention to these considerations is essential for robust and effective test
automation. By addressing these factors thoughtfully, TAEs can enhance the reliability and efficiency of
their automation efforts, ultimately contributing to the quality and success of the SUT.

 Certified Tester Test Automation Strategy Specialist (CT-TAS)

5.1 Investment in Setting Up and Maintaining Test Automation
5.1.1 Show Return On Investment of Building a Test Automation Solution
It is important to estimate the setup and maintenance costs of test automation before proceeding to start a
project implementation. Beyond the values that automation can bring to a project, understanding the ROI
calculation for the project is beneficial.
The ROI calculation can provide meaningful feedback at any given moment in a project lifecycle by
demonstrating the return for an activity for the effort invested. The ROI calculation can be further adjusted
by including both manual tester costs and TAE costs by simply multiplying the time spent with their
respective labor costs.
To calculate the ROI, one needs to determine the investment of test automation (i.e., time and cost) and
the savings achieved with it:
ROI = Savings / Investment
It is important to note that the savings and the investment can be calculated considering different metrics
and data, in different measures and units. In the scope of this syllabus, a simple model is used to
demonstrate the approach, with time units and not the cost. If certain activities are only measured in cost,
that amount can be converted to time using a rate specific to the project.
Generally, the savings achieved by test automation are because the same tests can be run in significantly
shorter time than run manually. This also means they can be run more often. Therefore, the number of tests
being executed can be increased.
To calculate savings, you need to consider the following metrics:
     ●      Time to run a test case manually
     ●      Time to run an automated test case
     ●      Number of test cases
     ●      Number of test runs
To calculate investment, you need to consider the following metrics:
     ●      Time to set up test automation
     ●      Average time to develop automated test scripts
     ●      Number of automated test scripts implemented
     ●      Average maintenance time of an automated test script
     ●      Time to run an automated test script
     ●      Percentage of failed automated test scripts
     ●      Number of test cases defined
     ●      Number of test runs
By adapting the outlined model to Agile software development, a project’s sprints can be forecast as
illustrated in the graph below. One can determine the sprint from which test automation has returned its
investment by using the graph.

 Certified Tester Test Automation Strategy Specialist (CT-TAS)

Figure 2: An Example of an ROI calculation showing the point of Return on Investment
Keep in mind certain connections between the metrics measured to calculate the ROI, including:
     ●      If the planned project duration is less than the turning point of the ROI, it is not worth introducing
            test automation. In this case, by executing the tests manually, time and effort are saved.
     ●      As the investment depends significantly on the execution time of the automated tests, applying the
            test pyramid and implementing test cases at the right test level can reduce this execution time and
            improve ROI.

5.2 Test Automation Metrics
5.2.1 Classify Metrics for Test Automation
Analyzing trends based on factual data helps in decision making. By collecting metrics of a TAS, the testers
are able to evaluate the TAS and make decisions on:
     ●      TAS suitability to the project
     ●      TAS adaptability for expanded functionality for new test conditions
               ○ A change in a user flow in the SUT
               ○ A change in how testing is performed
     ●      Maintainability of test automation because of defects found in the TAS
The cost of measuring should be as low as possible, and this can often be achieved by automating the
collection and reporting of metrics. Some examples can be seen below.

 Certified Tester Test Automation Strategy Specialist (CT-TAS)

Pass-fail ratio
This is a common metric and tracks the ratio of the automated tests that passed to the automated tests that
failed to achieve the expected result. The pass-fail ratio = the number of tests that passed / the number of
tests that failed.
Ratio of failures to defects
A common problem with automated tests is that many of them can fail for the same reason, i.e., a single
defect in the SUT. Measuring the number of automated tests that fail for a given defect can help indicate
where this may be a problem. Additionally, one may collect the number of failures per defect and track the
reason for failure: defect in the sub-system, in the whole system, issue with the test data, or infrastructure.
Test automation execution time
One of the easier metrics to determine is the time it takes to execute the automated tests. In the beginning
of the TAS this might not be important, but as the number of automated test cases increases, this metric
may become quite important. This metric includes the build time of the TAS.
Number of automated test cases
This metric can be used to show the progress made by the test automation project. But one has to take into
account that the number of automated test cases does not reveal much information; for example, it does
not indicate the level of coverage.
Functional coverage of test automation
This coverage indicates the percentage of functional requirements covered by automated test cases.
Code coverage
Code coverage tracks how many lines of code is exercised by lower level (i.e., component) tests.
There is no absolute percentage that indicates adequate coverage, and 100% code coverage is often
difficult to attain in anything other than the simplest software. However, it is generally agreed that more
coverage is better as it increases confidence in the SUT. As additional low-level automated tests are added,
code coverage is expected to increase.

5.3 The Value of Test Automation on the Project and Organization Level
5.3.1 Identify Organizational Considerations for Use of Test Automation
Before starting test automation on any project, one needs to identify the following within the organization:
Policies and practices for software development
It is good to check how the development teams are working and what kind of documentation is present.
Any available documentation can be beneficial to identify how test automation can be connected into the
processes of the development teams. Documentation can include the SUT’s technical specification, the
software and development tools used, or any available policies about development, such as code review
guidelines, defined coding standards, and merge processes.

 Certified Tester Test Automation Strategy Specialist (CT-TAS)

Existing active test automation projects and their status
In the case of an ongoing development project, there can be one or more ongoing TAS development
projects by different teams. A general recommendation for the decision makers is to check these existing
projects and their status, to see if any of them fit within the defined test objectives of the new TAS. By
analyzing the solution, one can determine whether to reuse any of the existing TAS or to create a new one
based on the current needs.
The organization’s subject matter experts for test automation
It is recommended to look for SMEs who can assist in the roll out of a new TAS within the organization. The
SMEs can share stories and lessons learned about their TAS and their rollout. From this, one can identify
different risks that need to be considered or avoided to have a successful TAS rollout.
Availability of test environments
In the case of large organizations, a general recommendation is to gather information about the existing
test environments, their use, and availability. This information is crucial to avoid ruining any other team's
work by rolling out a new TAS and using the system without any notification or agreement. Often, the needs
of a project will require a new test environment, so the existing ones can be used as a baseline in creating
a new one and the work can be done more easily if the responsible teams and persons are identified and
available.
Test tools and licenses
It is always worthwhile to get information about what tools and licenses the organization currently has. By
identifying these, costs, and timelines, planning of a TAS can be reduced. And tools for a new project may
already be available. For example, if cloud testing is set up through a defined provider, and the licenses
are available for the new project, it does not make sense to use a different cloud provider. It is recommended
to use the same tools and licenses to reduce project costs.

5.3.2 Analyze Project Characteristics that Help Determine Optimal Implementation of
      Test Automation Test Objectives
There are several major project characteristics that can define an optimal way of working, and to help
define successful test automation objectives.
Domain
It is important to understand that each domain differs either in regulations or standards. For example, there
are different regulations and risks in the tourism domain compared to finance or healthcare. It is always
recommended to check the different standards and domain restrictions to make sure that the planned test
automation objectives comply.
Platforms
In terms of test automation test objectives, it is also emphasized to evaluate which platforms the project
covers and where it would be beneficial to do test automation. Planning for multiple platform test automation
can be more difficult since there may be a need for multiple solutions to cover the different platforms. In
many cases, such as for mobile and web, the same tools can be used. But planning will determine
reusability of the TAS.

Programming language and technology stack

 Certified Tester Test Automation Strategy Specialist (CT-TAS)

The implementation details of a project, like its programming language and technology stack, also
determine what kind of test automation test objectives an organization should define. It is recommended to
use the same programming languages that the developers are using on a given project. By doing so,
collaboration can be much easier, and cross learning by carrying out code reviews together will improve
the quality of the SUT and the knowledge of the TAEs even further.
Maturity of the project
By analyzing the maturity of the project, information can be derived to design the ideal test automation
objective. By identifying the different factors such as the number of test cases, existing CI/CD pipelines,
number of testers and TAEs, different test objectives and a roadmap can be created. For example, if there
are a lot of manual test cases that have high priority and their manual test execution time is long, it is
important to aim to get these automated first to save time and effort. Apart from the above factors, the
timeline of the project is also very important. If the project is short or will end shortly and there is not much
time to get things done, it is not worth planning a big and robust TAS. However, if the project is a greenfield
project, it is worth devising a step-by-step minimum viable product-based incremental roadmap.
Stakeholder buy-in
Many times, test automation is not leveraged due to key stakeholders not buying into it. That can be due
to fears of velocity dropping below their target, tight deadlines, budgeting, or other concerns. After
analysis of the project maturity, if there is room to start implementing a TAS, a strategic stakeholder
needs to identify the product risks, list the benefits of introducing test automation, and come up with an
appropriate plan. This plan needs to highlight the milestones to be achieved with and by test automation
and indicate how the testability of the SUT needs to be improved to successfully introduce a TAS that will
address the identified risks. Lastly, this plan needs to be presented to the stakeholders.
Team knowledge and relevant experience
The most important and relevant factor for successful test automation is a testers’ skills and experience. It
is beneficial to work with the testers and use their knowledge to define test objectives that they and the
business analysts are comfortable with. Often test managers or test leaders create a competency and
skill matrix to identify the available knowledge within the teams, and to identify the gaps at the same time.
These gaps can be identified with different goals such as training and assigned implementation tasks.
Test management support and budgeting
Depending on the size and maturity of the given project, the available budget and test management
support should be considered, while defining the test objectives for test automation. It is important to
define test objectives that can be met, which in return will enable support from test management.
When making a test automation strategy proposal to management, the documentation needs to be
concise, clearly defining currently identified gaps or future costs for test automation is implemented
correctly. A list of recommendations and their benefits pointing out the business value and cost reductions
will encourage test management to approve developing or improving a TAS.

Quality characteristics
The ISO/IEC 25010:2011 defines the quality characteristics that are listed in the ISTQB CTFL Syllabus,
section 2.2.2. Test Types. These quality characteristics can then be used for evaluating the current TAS,
or determining metrics that will be collected by the TAS.

5.4 Decisions Made from Test Automation Reports
5.4.1 Analyze Test Report Data to Inform Decision Making
The format and the content of a test automation report may vary depending on the stakeholders receiving
it. It can be created for management, operational or technical stakeholders. Additional information can be
found in the CTAL-TAE Syllabus, section 6.1.3.
Upon receiving a test automation report, it can be incorporated into a broader test report, or it can be
consolidated, and then escalated within the organizational structure.
Different stakeholders find different values in such a test automation report. A strategic approach is to
identify key metrics that are important for the stakeholders involved by emphasizing these important
metrics.
Data collected with automation can help:
     ●      Identify trends and perform root cause analysis
     ●      Shift test automation efforts to maintenance
     ●      Shift test automation efforts to improvements and further development of a TAF
     ●      Add capabilities to the overall TAS
     ●      Increase shift left and shift right approaches to testing
     ●      Expand the functional coverage of test automation in future sprints
     ●      Focus more on defect clusters
     ●      Advise developers of areas to improve the code
     ●      Advise on the overall SDLC processes
     ●      Change the content and format of future test automation reports
Based on the information described above, the TAEs in collaboration with other stakeholders can identify
gaps and certain improvement points in the existing test automation coverage and test results.

6.1 Transitioning Activities from Manual Testing to Continuous Testing
6.1.1 Describe the Factors and Planning Activities in Transitioning from Manual Testing
      to Test Automation
The easiest opportunity for transitioning from manual testing to test automation is to target regression
testing. A regression test suite grows as today’s functional and non-functional tests become tomorrow’s
regression tests. It is only a matter of time before the number of regression tests becomes greater than
the time and resources available to a traditional manual test team.
Transitioning costs
During transition from manual testing to automated testing, the project should expect increased costs as
both manual testing and automated testing take place simultaneously. Once automated tests are deemed
to adequately replace or supersede manual test execution activities, more effort can be shifted towards
exploratory testing and defining additional test cases for test automation, which has a different cost
compared to manual regression testing.
Functional overlap
Functional overlap occurs when test script developers include the same exact test automation steps in
different test cases. For example, most test cases will start with a login sequence of test steps. This can
include entering a username, password, and selecting a login button. Adding it in each test case increases
maintenance activities. If there is ever an additional test step added to the login process, the same change
will have to be updated in every test case. A better approach is to make a repeatable test automation
component out of the login process and have all test cases reference that functionality. See the CTAL-TAE
Syllabus, section 3.1.5 for details about the flow model pattern.
Data sharing
Tests often share test data. This can occur when tests use the same record of test data to execute different
SUT functionality. An example of this might be test case “A” which verifies an employee’s available vacation
time, while test case “B” verifies what courses the employee took as part of their career development goals.
Each test case uses the same employee but verifies different parameters. In a manual test environment,
the employee test data would typically be duplicated many times across each manual test case which
verified employee test data using this employee. However, in an automated test, test data which is shared
should, where possible and feasible, be stored and accessed from a single source to avoid duplication, or
the introduction of errors.
Test interdependency
When executing complex regression tests, one test may have a dependency on one or more other tests.
This occurrence can be quite common. For example, a new “Order ID” gets created as a result of a test
step. Subsequent tests may want to verify that: a) the new order is correctly displayed in the system, b)
changes to the order are possible, or c) deleting the order is successful. In each case, the “Order ID” value
which is dynamically created in the first test must be captured for reuse by later tests. Depending on the
design of the TAS, this can be addressed. If the “Order ID” cannot be found by subsequent test cases, they
will fail.

 Certified Tester Test Automation Strategy Specialist (CT-TAS)

Test execution preconditions
All too often TAEs will immediately begin test script development without first understanding the
preconditions that go into making sure a test case can execute reliably. This can become extremely
challenging when trying to execute a test case against the same SUT in multiple test environments.
Examples of preconditions include usernames, account roles, data table values, and other specific data
entries that make the test case repeatable. A good strategy will include upfront analysis to understand what
information needs to exist in the SUT before automating a particular test case. Additionally, the strategy
can be enhanced by automating the creation of preconditions prior to the real test cases running, to save
time. This may include running precondition test scripts that populate the SUT from the UI or automated
batch processes that load test data to a database.
Functional coverage
Identify the functional gaps in testing that can be candidates for test automation, as explained in Chapter
3. 100% of the manual test cases that are automated does not represent 100% of all possible test cases
that can be automated with test tools. As more tests become automated, testers get back test execution
time which they can use to identify additional SUT tests to increase coverage.
Executable tests
Before converting a manual regression test into an automated regression test, it is important to verify that
the manual regression test operates correctly. This then provides the correct starting point to ensure a
successful conversion to an automated regression test. If the manual regression test does not execute
correctly, it may be because it was poorly written, uses invalid test data, is out of date or out of sync with
the current SUT, or because of an SUT defect. Automating it prior to understanding and/or resolving the
root cause of the failure will create a non-functioning automated regression test which is wasteful and
unproductive. It is important to demonstrate equivalent functionality that the new automated tests bring, to
convey confidence in automated tests that will replace the old manual tests.

6.1.2 Describe the Factors and Planning Activities in Transitioning from Test
      Automation to Continuous Testing
Continuous testing involves utilizing test assets far more frequently than in traditional SDLCs. This is done
by starting to constantly run test suites immediately after code changes are done and made available in the
test environments. This helps provide immediate feedback and reduces defect costs by catching defects
earlier in the process. This can be handled with sophisticated development tools and the willingness to shift
testing earlier in the build process.

 Certified Tester Test Automation Strategy Specialist (CT-TAS)

    Adapting the TAS for continuous testing requires the following:
     ●      The test suites need to change to run on the updated TAS: make the necessary changes to the
            test suites and test them before deploying them on the TAS
     ●      Stubs, drivers, and interfaces used in testing need to change to fit with the updated TAS: make
            the necessary changes to the test harness and test it before deploying it on the TAS
     ●      The infrastructure needs to change to accommodate the updated TAS: make an assessment of
            the infrastructure components that need to be changed
     ●      The updated TAS has additional defects or performance defects: perform an analysis of risks
            versus benefits. If the defects discovered make it impossible to update the TAS, it may be best
            not to proceed with the update or to wait for a next version of the TAS. If the defects are
            negligible compared to the benefits of correcting them, the TAS can still be updated.
     ●      Be sure to create release notes of known defects to notify the TAEs and other stakeholders and
            try to get an estimate of when the defects are going to be fixed
All of the points mentioned in this section become particularly important when utilizing CI/CD. Putting
together pipelines and automating the build process is a natural fit with the TAS being developed. If the
build orchestration tool is in the correct test environment, the pipeline can be extended to include automated
tests to verify the SUT right after deployment. This requires that the test automation tool be properly
configured and can access the SUT, and that it can reach out to the code repository and access data
provisioning scripts.

6.2 Test Automation Strategy Across the Organization
6.2.1 Conduct an Evaluation of the Test Automation Assets and Practices to Identify
      Improvement Areas
Just like any other development activity, it is important to have a strategy for pausing the TAS development
and looking for opportunities to refactor the solution. The areas to monitor are initial implementation,
maintenance, and the ability to evaluate the solution from a repeatability standpoint. Some good categories
to keep track of are how many hours are spent developing the TAS, how many hours are spent fixing the
TAS, and how much time savings do the testers realize compared to manual testing. An indicator that
something is wrong is if the TAS maintenance time is greater than the manual testing time.

 Certified Tester Test Automation Strategy Specialist (CT-TAS)

Before starting with the first deployment of a TAS, it is important to be sure it can run in its own environment,
it is isolated from random changes, and test cases can be updated and managed. Both the TAS and its
infrastructure must be maintained. In the case of first-time deployment, the following basic steps are
needed:
     ●      Code coverage tools indicate how much of the code is exercised by the component test suite, and
            where gaps exist that can be covered through additional component tests
     ●      SUT functional coverage can be determined by creating a requirements traceability matrix, which
            uncovers which functionality is not yet covered by any test cases
     ●      Define a consistent infrastructure usage of the TAS across projects or the whole organization
     ●      Develop a consistent configuration management strategy for the test suites
     ●      Create common TAS development guidelines leveraging best practices described in the CTAL-
            TAE Syllabus, section 3.1.4
     ●      Implement preconditions. Often a test cannot be executed prior to setting preconditions. These
            preconditions may include selecting the correct database or the test data from which to test or
            setting initial values or parameters. Many of these initialization steps that are required to establish
            a test’s preconditions can be automated. This allows for a more reliable and dependable solution
            when these steps cannot be missed prior to executing the tests. As regression tests are converted
            to test automation, these preconditions need to be a part of the test automation process.
When incremental TAS updates occur for new features or maintenance purposes, the following should be
considered:
     ●      Evaluate updates to test tools or other newer test tools that can provide extended capabilities for
            the TAS
     ●      Evaluate ways in which to further optimize TAS features and performance
     ●      Identify opportunities to further decompose and modularize test scripts to enhance reusability
     ●      Ensure knowledge and awareness of reusable components and consistent utilization
     ●      Collect evidence on potential improvement areas and to provide recommendations and their
            benefits
     ●      Evaluate and correct areas of functional overlap. When automating existing regression tests, it is
            good practice to identify any functional overlap that exists between test cases and, where possible,
            reuse previously developed test automation components.
     ●      Evaluate additional manual test cases for opportunity to automate them and create backlog items
            for implementation
     ●      Highlight test design and test data management improvement opportunities
     ●      Ensure all existing test suites are adapted to the latest version of the TAS
     ●      If test automation is causing the pipeline to queue, decrease the scope of integrated tests to the
            most critical ones, i.e., create a smoke test suite. The larger regression test suite can be triggered
            separately or executed on demand.
